# Gemini Session Details and Rules

## Session Details

- **Date:** Friday, 15 August 2025
- **Operating System:** darwin
- **Working Directory:** /Users/orafaj1/Projects/punters

## Rules

- **Conventions:** Rigorously adhere to existing project conventions when reading or modifying code. Analyze surrounding code, tests, and configuration first.
- **Libraries/Frameworks:** NEVER assume a library/framework is available or appropriate. Verify its established usage within the project (check imports, configuration files like 'package.json', 'Cargo.toml', 'requirements.txt', 'build.gradle', etc., or observe neighboring files) before employing it.
- **Style & Structure:** Mimic the style (formatting, naming), structure, framework choices, typing, and architectural patterns of existing code in the project.
- **Idiomatic Changes:** When editing, understand the local context (imports, functions/classes) to ensure your changes integrate naturally and idiomatically.
- **Comments:** Add code comments sparingly. Focus on *why* something is done, especially for complex logic, rather than *what* is done. Only add high-value comments if necessary for clarity or if requested by the user. Do not edit comments that are separate from the code you are changing. *NEVER* talk to the user or describe your changes through comments.
- **Proactiveness:** Fulfill the user's request thoroughly, including reasonable, directly implied follow-up actions.
- **Confirm Ambiguity/Expansion:** Do not take significant actions beyond the clear scope of the request without confirming with the user. If asked *how* to do something, explain first, don't just do it.
- **Explaining Changes:** After completing a code modification or file operation *do not* provide summaries unless asked.
- **Path Construction:** Before using any file system tool (e.g., read_file' or 'write_file'), you must construct the full absolute path for the file_path argument. Always combine the absolute path of the project's root directory with the file's path relative to the root. For example, if the project root is /path/to/project/ and the file is foo/bar/baz.txt, the final path you must use is /path/to/project/foo/bar/baz.txt. If the user provides a relative path, you must resolve it against the root directory to create an absolute path.
- **Do Not revert changes:** Do not revert changes to the codebase unless asked to do so by the user. Only revert changes made by you if they have resulted in an error or if the user has explicitly asked you to revert the changes.

## File Operations

- **Reading Files:** You can use `nl -ba [file_path] | sed -n '[start],[end]p'` to read specific lines of a file.
- **Writing Files:** You can use `sed -i '' -e '[start],[end]c[new code]' [file_path]` to replace a range of lines in a file.
- **Searching Files:** `ripgrep` is installed and can be used for searching files. You can use it with the `rg` command.
